# Power Consumption Prediction for Tetouan City

This project aims to recreate and improve upon the research paper “Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Power Consumption Prediction: Case Study of Tetouan City.” The goal is to reproduce the main results of the paper and propose an improved machine learning solution.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:
1. Reproduce the results presented in Table II of the research paper using Python modules and packages.
2. Propose and develop a novel machine learning solution to improve the prediction accuracy for power consumption in Tetouan City.

## Instructions Followed

### Reproducing the Results

To reproduce the results from the research paper, the following steps were taken:
- **Dataset**: The same dataset as used in the research paper.
- **Features**: The same set of features used by the authors.
- **Classifier**: The same classifier with exact parameter values.
- **Training/Test Split**: The same training/test splitting approach as used by the authors.
- **Pre/Post Processing**: The same pre/post processing, if any, used by the authors.
- **Performance Metrics**: The same performance metrics (RMSE and MAE) as shown in the paper.

### Proposed Machine Learning Solution

In addition to reproducing the results, a novel machine learning solution was developed. The proposed solution includes:
- **Different Feature Selection Approach**
- **Parameter Optimization Process**
- **Alternative ML Methods**
- **Regularization Techniques**
- **Combinations of the Above**

### Report Details

The report includes the following:
- **Motivation**: The motivation behind the proposed solution.
- **Differences**: How the proposed solution is different from existing ones.
